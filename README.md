# Multimodal Machine Learning on Spatial Transcriptomics

**Net4Brain Training School — Mini Project**

A three-day, end-to-end machine-learning pipeline on spatial transcriptomics data. Everything runs in Google Colab; no local installation and no GPU are needed.

The workshop combines two modalities for every tissue spot:


| Modality            | What it is                          | Provenance                                    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Gene expression** | Highly variable genes per spot      | 10x Genomics Visium (measured)                |
| **Metabolic flux**  | 168 metabolic module rates per spot | scFEA (inferred from the expression data)     |

## The two datasets

Steps are **demonstrated** on healthy cortex, then **repeated by students** on tumour tissue.


|                             | Demonstration | Student mini-project |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| **Tissue**                  | Healthy human DLPFC | Human glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype |
| **Spots**                   | 12,000 | 35,187 |
| **Subjects**                | 3 donors, 12 sections | 6 patients, 15 sections |
| **Genes**                   | 1,000 highly variable | 2,000 highly variable |
| **Flux modules**            | 168 | 168 |
| **Prediction task**         | Superficial (L1-L3) vs deep (L4-L6) layers | Tumour core vs periphery |
| **Grouping for evaluation** | Donor | Patient |
| **Notebook** | `Demo_DLPFC.ipynb` <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/Occhipinti-Lab/Workshop_Net4Brain/blob/main/Demo_DLPFC.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a> | `Mini_Project_Spatial_notebook.ipynb` <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/Occhipinti-Lab/Workshop_Net4Brain/blob/main/Mini_Project_Spatial_notebook.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a> |


Each notebook is divided into **Day 1 / Day 2 / Day 3** sections matching the schedule below.
Days are sequential: Day 2 continues from the Day 1 variables, and Day 3 continues from Day 2.
If a Colab session disconnects, re-run the earlier cells.

Day 1 is plots. Day 2 is a train/test split, a logistic classifier, and a
three-way comparison of genes vs flux vs both. Day 3 explains that model with a
SHAP plot and the logistic coefficients.

## Running the notebooks

### On Google Colab (recommended for students)

1. Open [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com) → **GitHub** → paste this repository URL.
2. Open the notebook you want.
3. Uncomment and run `!pip install -q scanpy shap` in the first code cell, then run the setup
  cell. The next cell downloads the data tables from this repository (about 48 MB for the
   glioblastoma data).



### Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Occhipinti-Lab/Workshop_Net4Brain.git
cd Workshop_Net4Brain
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scanpy scikit-learn shap jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

Students present their results on the final day.

## Data

The `dataset/` folder contains everything the notebooks need. All tables are gzipped CSVs with
the spot ID in the first column, and **the three tables for each dataset share the same row
index** — that alignment is what makes the analysis multimodal.


| File                           | Contents                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dlpfc_gene_expression.csv.gz` | 12,000 spots × 1,000 genes, log-normalised                  |
| `dlpfc_flux.csv.gz`            | 12,000 spots × 168 metabolic modules                        |
| `dlpfc_metadata.csv.gz`        | Section, donor, layer annotation, spot coordinates          |
| `gbm_gene_expression.csv.gz`   | 35,187 spots × 2,000 genes, log-normalised                  |
| `gbm_flux.csv.gz`              | 35,187 spots × 168 metabolic modules                        |
| `gbm_metadata.csv.gz`          | Patient, section, region, detailed region, spot coordinates |
| `scfea_module_info.csv`        | Module ID → reaction, so `M_40` can be named                |




### How the metabolic flux was generated

Both datasets are Visium spatial transcriptomics, so the only molecule assayed at each spot is mRNA. 
The flux tables were computed from the gene expression with [scFEA](https://github.com/changwn/scFEA), 
which we ran before the workshop.

scFEA represents human central metabolism as a graph of metabolites and reactions, collapses it
into 168 modules (each a short chain of consecutive reactions), maps each module to the genes
encoding its enzymes, and trains a small neural network to predict a per-module flux from those
genes. Its loss penalises imbalance of intermediate metabolites, flow in must match flow out,
which is what makes the output more than a rescaled average of the module's genes.

The pipeline we ran, starting from the raw count matrices of the two published datasets:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/changwn/scFEA.git

# input: a genes x spots raw count matrix as CSV
python src/scFEA.py \
  --input_dir  <dir containing the count matrix> \
  --test_file  <counts.csv> \
  --moduleGene_file       module_gene_m168.csv \
  --stoichiometry_matrix  cmMat_c70_m168.csv \
  --cName_file            cName_c70_m168.csv \
  --sc_imputation True \
  --train_epoch 30 \
  --output_flux_file      <flux.csv>
```

`module_gene_m168.csv` maps genes to modules; `cmMat_c70_m168.csv` is the stoichiometry matrix
(70 compounds × 168 modules). The human M168 module set was used for both datasets. The
glioblastoma data was processed in per-patient batches for memory reasons and the outputs
concatenated. In both cases the resulting flux table was reindexed onto the same spot order as
the expression and metadata tables, and that alignment is asserted in the notebooks.

`dataset/scfea_module_info.csv` is scFEA's own module annotation file
(`Human_M168_information.symbols.csv`), shipped locally.
